<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<p>1.1 This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of User information collected by and on Genesis. The aim of this Privacy Policy is to help you understand how your personal information is used and your choices regarding said use. By using Genesis, you agree that the Foundation can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only applies to Genesis, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via Genesis. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.</p>

<p>Genesis may evolve over time, and this Privacy Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If changes are made, you will be notified by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy. In some cases, if significant changes are made, an statement may be placed in the homepage. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed.</p>

<p>Some third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use Genesis might be affected.</p>

<h2 id="information_use">3. The Way your Personal Information is used</h2>
<p>3.1 As with nearly all interactions that take place on the World Wide Web, the servers may receive information by virtue of your interaction with them, including but not limited to IP Addresses.</p>

<p>3.2 Genesis requires full browser permissions that could potentially be used to access additional personal information. Such browser permissions are used for an extremely limited technical purpose for allowing Genesis to properly interact with your browser. No additional information is obtained beyond what is necessary to provide Genesis. No information received is shared with any third-party except as required for provision of Genesis.</p>

<p>3.3 Google Analytics is used for purposes of monitoring web traffic. Any identifying information collected via Google Analytics is controlled by Google, Inc.</p>

<p>4.2 Your information may be shared with third parties who need to access it in order to do work related to Genesis, including doing things like helping make Genesis available, or providing analytics services. These third parties only access and use your information as necessary to perform their functions.</p>

<p>4.3 Aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information may be created in a way that does not directly identify you. Those aggregations and anonymizations may be used or shared for a variety of purposes related to Genesis.</p>

<p>4.4 Your personal information may be disclosed to agents, businesses, or service providers who process your personal information for providing Genesis to you. The agreements with these service providers limit the kinds of information they can use or process and ensure they use reasonable efforts to keep your personal information secure.</p>

<p>4.5 The Foundation also reserves the right to disclose personal information that it believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce the Terms of Use, take precautions against liability or harm, to investigate and respond to third-party claims or allegations, to respond to court orders or official requests, to protect the security or integrity of Genesis, and to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Foundation, the community of Genesis users and token owners, or others.</p>

<p>4.6 In the event that the Foundation is involved in a merger, acquisition, sale, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors’ rights generally, or other change of control, there may be a disclosure of your information to another entity related to such event.</p>

You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction that is confirmed and managed via the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<h2 id="information_security">8. Information Security</h2>
<p>Whilst neither the Foundation, nor any other organization, can guarantee the security of information processed online, the Foundation has appropriate security measures in place to protect your personal information.
