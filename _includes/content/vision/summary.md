<p>Genesis is a multicreator gaming universe, with a diverse community working together to achieve a common goal: A metaverse that will still be growing, evolving, and actively played in 100 years.</p>

Genesis will run as a nonprofit, with all assets owned by and revenue earned by the Genesis Foundation reinvested in the long-term success of the game.</p>
